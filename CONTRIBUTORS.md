- **About Me**: I am a software engineer and data scientist. I am passionate about making an impact on others' minds, and I built this project originally as part of a class at Make School.
Feature: initial work on the front end design using Bootstrap 4, using MongoDB to store users' favorite Tweets, and integrating the Twitter API.

- **Fun Fact**: As a kid I remember being told I'd make a good lawyer when I grew up. Although I have 2 uncles that work as attorneys and 1 that's a judge, I am glad to stay a web developer and make political impact through the Internet!
